Imagine a classroom with desks where each desk has a student. Think of the 2D Array as a grid, with rows going left to right and columns going up and down. Each element in the array can be referenced by the specifying the row and column we wish to select. 

The first element in the desks array, `desks[0]` contains an array with 4 elements, `[‘Adam’, ‘Ben’, ‘Carl’, ‘David’]`.

| | C0 | C1 | C2 | C3
|-|-|-|-|-|
|R0| 'Adam' | 'Ben' | 'Carl' | 'David' |
|R1| 'Edward' |'Frank' | 'Georgia' | 'Helen' |
|R2| 'Isabelle' | 'Joan' | 'Kelly' | 'Linda' |
