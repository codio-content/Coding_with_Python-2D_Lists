You are going to learn about two-dimensional (2D) lists by studying some theory and having a go at the challenges given.

Here is an example of two-dimensional data:

```python
'Alice',23,'Blue','Audi'
'Tariq',18,'Red','Mini'
'Bob',31,'Green','Renault'
```

Here is how the data would be represented in a two-dimensional array:

```python
people = [ 
  ['Alice',23,'Blue','Audi'],
  ['Tariq',18,'Red','Mini'], 
  ['Bob',31,'Green','Renault'] 
]
```
