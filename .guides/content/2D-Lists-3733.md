We are now going to introduce you to 2 dimensional lists with some theory and some challenges.

Here's an example of 2 dimensional data 

```python
'Alice',23,'Blue','Audi'
'Tariq',18,'Red','Mini'
'Bob',31,'Green','Renault'
```

and here's how it is represented in a 2 dimensional array.

```python
people = [ 
  ['Alice',23,'Blue','Audi'],
  ['Tariq',18,'Red','Mini'], 
  ['Bob',31,'Green','Renault'] 
]
```
